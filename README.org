#+TITLE: Simple Anti-Spam Bot for Telegram
* Usage
In order to run the bot, you need the following environment variables.
#+begin_example
TELOXIDE_TOKEN="..."
SPAM_STR="..."
#+end_example
 =TELOXIDE_TOKEN= is your telegram bot API token. If you do not know what it is, check [[https://core.telegram.org/bots][Bots: An introduction for developers]]. =SPAM_STR= is a string of the spam strings you want to detect against, separated with colon, e.g. ="this is a spam:this is another spam"=.

An easy way to run is put the following in a script, and run before calling `cargo run`
#+begin_src shell
export TELOXIDE_TOKEN="..."
# uncomment the following to change logging level
# export RUST_LOG=info
export SPAM_STR="..."
#+end_src
